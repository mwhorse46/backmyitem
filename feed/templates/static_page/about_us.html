            BackMyItem is a web application where your lost item will be publish by an unknown user. You can connect to that user from this application.
        </p>
         <br>
        <p>
            In this fast world we forget our item like documents, keys, cards, wallets, purse , resport card , passport etc at public places like train, malls, shops, Government and private offices etc but once we lost it then it becomes very hard for us to retrieve the item.
        </p>
         <br>
        <p>
            If someone find your's item and if he wants to return the item to the owner then it becomes impossible by him to communicate with the owner of the item or to identify the real owner of the unclaimed stuff because an item like keys never talks to us.
        </p> <br>
        <p>
